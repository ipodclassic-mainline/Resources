This repo just contains images for the wiki, as well as some other docs and stuff.

The S5l8700X datasheet is from the Rockbox wiki, I'm only mirroring it here for legacy purposes (and in case the rockbox wiki goes down).
It has a different register map to the S5L8702 in the 6g, but it's still quite a useful guide, the rockbox source code somewhat documents
the differences.
